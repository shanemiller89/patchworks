We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions of Patchworks:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Patchworks seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities privately using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/shanemiller89/patchworks/security/advisories) of our repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send an email to: `security@patchworks.dev` (if available) or the maintainer's email
   - Include "[SECURITY]" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** - A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact** - What kind of impact could an attacker achieve?
- **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof of Concept** - If possible, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Environment** - Node.js version, OS, package version where you found the issue
- **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas on how to fix it

### üïê Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports in a timely manner:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Triage**: Within 7 days we will provide an initial assessment
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: After the fix is released, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability

### üèÜ Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help us keep Patchworks secure:

- We will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Your name will be added to our contributors list
- We may provide a reference letter for responsible disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Patchworks, follow these security best practices:

1. **Keep Updated** - Always use the latest version of Patchworks
2. **Review Updates** - Check release notes and changelogs before updating dependencies
3. **Audit Dependencies** - Run `npm audit` regularly in your projects
4. **Limited Permissions** - Don't run Patchworks with elevated privileges unless necessary
5. **Environment Isolation** - Consider using Patchworks in isolated environments for sensitive projects

### For Contributors

If you're contributing to Patchworks:

1. **Secure Dependencies** - Only add necessary dependencies from trusted sources
2. **Input Validation** - Validate all external inputs (API responses, file contents, user input)
3. **No Hardcoded Secrets** - Never commit API keys, tokens, or other secrets
4. **Code Review** - All security-related changes must be reviewed by maintainers
5. **Testing** - Include security test cases for new features

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Features

- **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Dependency Scanning** - Regular automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **No Network Admin Required** - Patchworks doesn't require administrative network access
- **Read-Only Mode** - The `reports` command operates in read-only mode
- **Secure API Calls** - All external API calls use HTTPS

### Potential Security Risks

Users should be aware of these potential risks:

1. **Package Installation** - When using `--install`, packages are installed from npm registry
2. **Network Requests** - Patchworks makes HTTP requests to fetch package metadata and release notes
3. **File System Access** - Patchworks reads and may modify `package.json` and related files
4. **External APIs** - The tool interacts with npm registry and GitHub APIs

### Security Controls

- **Opt-in Installation** - Package installation requires explicit `--install` flag
- **Limited Scope** - Only modifies files explicitly configured by the user
- **No Automatic Execution** - Never executes code from downloaded packages
- **Transparent Operations** - All operations are logged and visible to the user

## Dependency Security

We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scanning** - GitHub Dependabot monitors for vulnerable dependencies
- **Regular Updates** - Dependencies are updated regularly to include security patches
- **Minimal Dependencies** - We minimize the number of dependencies to reduce attack surface
- **Trusted Sources** - Only use dependencies from well-maintained, trusted packages

## Compliance and Standards

Patchworks follows security best practices including:

- **OWASP Guidelines** - Following OWASP secure coding practices
- **Node.js Security** - Adhering to Node.js security best practices
- **NPM Security** - Following npm package security guidelines
- **OpenSSF Best Practices** - Implementing OpenSSF security scorecard recommendations

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- **Prioritized** - Security fixes take priority over feature development
- **Clearly Documented** - Security fixes are clearly marked in release notes
- **Promptly Released** - Critical security fixes are released as patch versions immediately
- **Backwards Compatible** - Security fixes maintain backwards compatibility when possible

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub Security Advisories or email with [SECURITY] subject
- **General Questions**: Open a GitHub issue for non-sensitive security questions
- **Documentation**: Refer to this security policy and our main documentation

## Acknowledgments

We thank the security research community for helping keep Patchworks and its users safe.
